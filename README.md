# Bluetooth-2WD-Robot
Very simple code for remotely controlling a 2DW robot using HC-05 or HC-06 Bluetooth model and an Arduino board.


The code does not contain any arrays or even switch cases as well as no need for if else if conditions, it is very simple and easy to use with remotely controlled mobile robots through a Bluetooth module. You just have to follow the instructions for wiring connection and pins orientation also the used alphabet characters.

# Wiring Connection:

IN1  ---> 2
IN3  ---> 3
IN2  ---> 4
IN4  ---> 5

## Note that the numbers are not in order and you have to focus on the order of the Arduino pins used in this example.

# Alphabets and The characters used in communication:
